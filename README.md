# WVC-Inverters-Esphome
WVC RF microinverters components for esphome


It works with both HW revisions of WVC inverters that work with HC-12 RF module, for R2 inverters only WVC1200 is supported (wrong values for other models), only 4 wires needed, VCC (3.3v), GND, TX-> RX and RX->TX

Currently, works with only one inverter at the time, however you can create two or more components and they will answer randomly asigning values to the first component
